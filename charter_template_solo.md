# PROJECT CHARTER — ONE-PERSON PROJECT TEMPLATE

---

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Project Title
[Insert project name]

### 1.2 Project Summary
Briefly describe what the project will build and why it matters.

### 1.3 Background / Problem Statement
- What problem are you solving?
- Why is this the right time to build it?

### 1.4 Vision Statement
The ideal end-state once the project is complete.

---

## 2. Objectives & Success Criteria

### 2.1 Project Objectives
List 2–5 measurable goals.

### 2.2 Success Criteria
Define what “successful completion” means for you:
- Functional completeness  
- Performance expectations  
- Usability expectations  
- Personal goals (learning, portfolio, productivity, etc.)

---

## 3. Project Scope

### 3.1 In-Scope
Features and components you *will* implement.

### 3.2 Out-of-Scope
Features you explicitly *will not* implement.

### 3.3 Assumptions
Any conditions you assume will remain true (e.g., access to datasets, cluster resources, libraries).

### 3.4 Constraints
Time, tools, compute limits, or other constraints.

---

## 4. Deliverables

### 4.1 Main Deliverables
- Final working software  
- Documentation (README, usage instructions, API notes)  
- Test results  
- Deployment artifacts  

### 4.2 Interim Deliverables / Checkpoints
Examples:
- Initial design outline  
- Prototype  
- MVP  
- Final polish pass  

---

## 5. Requirements

### 5.1 Functional Requirements
What the system must do (user actions, system behavior).

### 5.2 Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance  
- Reliability  
- Ease of use  
- Portability / environment support  

### 5.3 Data & Resource Requirements
- Input data  
- Storage  
- Compute/GPU needs  
- External libraries or tools  

---

## 6. High-Level Architecture (Optional for Solo Projects)

### 6.1 Architecture Summary
A simple paragraph describing design or data flow.

### 6.2 Technology Stack
Languages, frameworks, platforms, compute resources.

---

## 7. Personal Workflow Plan

### 7.1 Development Workflow
- Branching strategy (simple: `main` + feature branches)  
- Commit frequency  
- Coding conventions  

### 7.2 Testing Strategy
Unit tests? Smoke tests? Manual verification?

### 7.3 Development Process
Suggested phases:
1. Requirements  
2. Design  
3. Implementation  
4. Testing  
5. Packaging / Deployment  

---

## 8. Timeline & Milestones

### 8.1 Timeline (Flexible for Solo Work)
Provide expected duration or a rough timeframe (e.g., 4 weeks).

### 8.2 Milestones
Examples:
- M1: Prototype done  
- M2: Core features implemented  
- M3: Testing completed  
- M4: Final release  

### 8.3 Completion Criteria per Milestone
A few bullet points to define “done.”

---

## 9. Risks & Mitigation (Lightweight)

### 9.1 Primary Risks
- Time availability  
- Technical unknowns  
- External dependencies  

### 9.2 Mitigation Strategies
How you will reduce impact if risks occur.

---

## 10. Acceptance Criteria
What must be true for you to declare the project finished.

---

## 11. Version Control & Documentation

### 11.1 Repo Location
[GitHub/GitLab URL]

### 11.2 Documentation Plan
README, examples, usage instructions.

---

## 12. Final Notes
Any personal notes, stretch goals, or future enhancements.
